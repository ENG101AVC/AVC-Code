Updates:
Started off with just the pi, a couple of motors with wheels and a board to hold them all together.
Attatched all components to board - had some issues with screw sizes and space portioning.

Some of the terminal blocks on the R pi got in the way of the plastic spacers.
To overcome this issue I switched the orientation of the R pi and the PCB and used just screws at the places where spacers 
would not fit and cutting down longer spacers to fill gaps.
This has enabled all points of the R pi and PCB to be secured.

Replaced the main board with a shorter board in the hopes that this would make it easier for the robot to traverse the maze.

Attached the camera using default parts, one of which I needed to cut a notch into to accommodate a bolt.

Ideas:
Possible case to put over robot to hide parts and make it aesthetically pleasing designs include;
Dalek - possible issues with weight distribution, could overbalance when turning tight corners, size navigating maze(too big)
Apache Helicoptor - possible issues with size navigating maze unless the rotors sit above the maze walls, no guns
Dragon - possible issues with Rhaz accepting the idea
