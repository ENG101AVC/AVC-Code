Started off with just the pi, a couple of motors with wheels and a board to hold them all together.
-attatched all components to board - had some issues with screw sizes and space portioning.

Some of the terminal blocks on the R pi got in the way of the plastic spacers.
To overcome this issue I switched the orientation of the R pi and the PCB and used just screws at the places where spacers would not fit and cutting down longer spacers to fill gaps.
This has enabled all points of the R pi and PCB to be secured.

Replaced the main board with a shorter board in the hopes that this would make it easier for the robot to traverse the maze.

Attached the camera using default parts, one of which I needed to cut a notch into to accommodate a bolt.
