# AVC-Code

This is 'Team WhereIsJulius' AVC challenge for ENGR101 of the year 2016, this repository will contain all of our code relating to this assignment. Which gained a 70% in the final AVC with negative -2 for aesthetics.

## Project

Our project is to design and build an autonomous vehicle using a Raspberry Pi which can understand its surroundings, and process how to move through a course in the shortest amount of time. This course will require the use of image processing, sensors and networking to complete all four quadrants.
